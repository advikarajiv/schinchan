                Incase you live under a rock or are an alien species, you might not know who shinchan is so let me give you a short introduction.<br> 
                shinchan is a 5 year old kid who lives with his mom dad younger sister and his pet dog shiro, to be detailed Shin Chan, also known<br>
                as Crayon Shin-chan, is a popular Japanese animated character created by Yoshito Usui. The show follows the misadventures of a mischievous<br>
                 5-year-old boy named Shinnosuke Nohara, or Shin-chan, and his eccentric family.(totally didnt chat gpt that)Anywaysss lets get<br>
                 into the intresting part shall we?

            </p>
            <h4 class="sub">Why he is the best</h4>
            <div class="pic">

        </div>
        <p> Apart from being extremly cute do you even need a reason? well if you do the let me give you some, as you can see from the above<br>
             images he expresses himself freely, there are no socitial expectations that he hasnt challenged, a 5 year old boy is more secure<br>
              in his masculity than most people are
             Also his outfits are sooooo adorable, cutiepie <3</p>

            <p>He makes me laugh, his antiques are so funny and unique, he is so unpredictable you just cant ever control the little mind of his,<br>
                 he says harmless jokes and does harmless pranks on others just to annoy them and not hurt them. His free mind and dont care attitude<br>
                  towards others judgement makes him more special, life is way too short to worry about what others think</p>

                <p> He’s always so confident, no matter how wild or ridiculous the situation gets, and it’s kind of refreshing. He doesn’t worry about<br>
                     what others think or what's going to happen next—he just lives in the moment. His "What's the worst that can happen?" mentality<br>
                      really stands out in a world where people often stress over the smallest things.</p>

                      <h4 class="sub">What we should learn</h4>
                      <div class="pic">
                      <img src="C:\Users\USER\Downloads\592e3e52-78d4-4ed5-bb78-6e5d3c4a0309.jpeg" height="300" width="300">

                      <img src="C:\Users\USER\Downloads\49c9ff09-fd14-43b4-b58d-b3aa34619141.jpeg" height="300" width="300">
                    </div>
                    <p> Shin-chan shows us that love can bring people together, regardless of blood relation. He’s close to his parents and neighbors alike,<br>
                         showing that when there’s love, care, and respect, you can form a strong, almost family-like bond with anyone.Even though he often<br>
                          acts out and causes chaos, Shin-chan is real and honest in his actions. He doesn’t pretend to be someone he’s not, and that sincerity<br>
                         is something people appreciate, even if he drives everyone crazy with his antics!</p>

                            <img src="C:\Users\USER\Downloads\4e12e802-b457-4e8d-a130-1faba8a5a237.jpeg" height="300" width="300">

                            </div>
                            <p> Shin-chan may be a kid, but he has the courage to say whatever’s on his mind and do what he believes is right, no matter how silly<br>
                                 it may seem. His fearless attitude is something we could all benefit from—especially when it comes to standing up for ourselves and others.</p>   
                            <img src="C:\Users\USER\Downloads\b07ec112-f3bb-43e6-b383-f6317bffe7b9.jpeg"height="300" width="900">
                            <p> Despite all his antics, Shin-chan values his friends, especially characters like Kazama and Nene. He’s loyal to them, and even though<br>
                                 he’s a bit of a troublemaker, his friendships are always genuine</p>
                                 <h4 class="sub">What I learned</h4>
                                 <img src="C:\Users\USER\Downloads\3e01f76e-b042-4c76-b2ee-40ae8e224117.jpeg"height="500" width="900">
                                 <p>
                                    
                                    What I’ve learned is never be ashamed to express yourself, no matter how much another person might find it unreasonable.<br>
                                     As long as you stay true to yourself, there is nothing you can’t achieve. Life will always throw something or the other your way;<br>
                                      that’s just how it is. But the way you react to it can make one hell of a difference. We can always take it easy, like Shin-chan,<br>
                                       and think with a cool mind no matter how hard the situation is, and take a decision that sticks to our beliefs. To be unapologetically yourself,<br>
                                        to be kind, to be loyal, to be a good friend. And it made me realize that being weird doesn’t always have to be bad, <br>
                                        that I don’t have to fit into the categories anyone has made for me, and that only I can set a value to myself, and nobody <br>
                                        else can impose it onto me. Growing up as an introvert, this cartoon helped in so many ways which even I couldn’t help myself in. <3
